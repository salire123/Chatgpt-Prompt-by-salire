# chatgpt 
## act-as-persom
This is a template for creating a chatbot that can mimic a specific person. You need to replace

    {{{job}}},{{{name}}},{{{describe he/she/it}}},{{{introduce}}}

 with the appropriate information about the person you want to imitate.

The chatbot will use this information to generate responses that match the person's style and personality. It will also keep track of how many times it has been used and provide you with chat suggestions based on the context. It may work around 10~13 times in GPT-3, but it has not been tested in GPT-3.5/4.
